> - ✅ **AI care tips (LLM)** via our hosted backend (**internet required**)

---

## 📌 Quick Links

- **Research & Documentation Repo:** (see companion documentation repository)
- **Latest APK Release:** (provided by the team for demo)  
  > If you received `app-release.apk`, you’re ready to install.

---

## ✅ Requirements

### Option A (Recommended): Android Phone / Tablet
- Android device (Android **7.0+** recommended)
- Wi-Fi or cellular data (required for AI care tips)

### Option B: Android Emulator (Optional)
- Android Studio emulator (camera behavior depends on emulator settings)

### iPhone / iPad (iOS)

## 📲 Install Instructions (Android)

1. **Download** the APK file:
   - `app-release.apk` (provided by us)

2. On your Android device, open the APK from:
   - **Files / Downloads**, or
   - the app you downloaded it with (Chrome / Gmail / Drive)

3. If you see: **“For your security, your phone isn’t allowed to install unknown apps…”**
   - Tap **Settings**
   - Enable **Allow from this source** (Chrome / Files / Gmail—whichever opened the APK)
   - Return and open the APK again

4. Tap **Install**

5. Open the app:

## ✅ Demo Walkthrough (Recommended Order)

### 1) Launch + Navigation
1. Open **Planterbox**
2. Tap **Get Started**
3. You should reach the **Plant Identifier** screen

### 2) Upload Image (Best for Reliability)
1. Tap **Upload Image**
2. Select a plant photo from your gallery
3. Tap **Analyze Plant**
4. Expected result:
   - Plant label + confidence
   - AI-generated **Care Tips** text

> Upload is the most consistent method for demos because lighting/camera differences can affect classification.

### 3) Scan Using Camera (Optional)
1. Tap **Scan Plant**
2. Take a photo of a plant
3. Tap **Analyze Plant**
4. Expected result:
   - Plant label + confidence
   - AI-generated **Care Tips** text

---

## 🌐 Internet Note (Important)

- ✅ **Plant label + confidence** = computed **on-device** (works offline)
- ✅ **Care tips** = generated by **backend + LLM** (**requires internet**)

If the device has no internet:
- Plant classification still works
- AI care tips may fail (the app will show an error message)

---

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### Error: “AI analysis failed: Failed to connect …”
Most common causes:
- No internet (Wi-Fi/cellular disabled)
- Network blocks (restricted Wi-Fi)
- Backend service sleeping / temporarily unavailable

**Try:**
1. Confirm Wi-Fi or cellular is ON
2. Retry after ~10 seconds
3. If it persists, switch networks (hotspot often works)
4. Contact us—we can restart/wake the backend

---

### Error: 429 (quota) or 503 (unavailable)
This typically indicates an LLM/provider temporary limitation.

**Try:**
- Wait 30–60 seconds and try again
- Try a different image once

---

### APK won’t install
Common causes:
- “Unknown apps” not allowed  
  ✅ Enable **Install unknown apps** for the app used to open the APK (Chrome/Files/Gmail)
- Very old Android version  
  ✅ Prefer Android **7.0+**

---

## ✅ What a Successful Demo Looks Like

After **Upload Image → Analyze Plant**, you should see:
- Plant name (top)
- Confidence %
- Care Tips paragraph (AI-generated)

That confirms:
- On-device model inference works ✅
- Backend + LLM pipeline works ✅
